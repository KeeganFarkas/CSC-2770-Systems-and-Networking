Edlin is a line editor that I made for a project in my intro to systems and networking class. Similar to https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edlin. Use 'make' to compile and 'make run' to run on a linux machine.

If the user enters an "l", then the line editor will print the contents of the file.  If the user enters an "r" followed by a file name, then the line editor will erase its current contents are read the file.  If the user enters an "s" followed by a file name, the editor will write its contents line by line to the file.  If the user enters an "e" followed by a line number, a space, and then some text, then the editor will replace the corresponding line with the text.  If the user enters a "!" followed by a line number, a space, and then a Unix command, then the editor will pipe the corresponding line to the Unix command, and replace the line with the output of the Unix command.
